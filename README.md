TASK DESCRIPTION:I created a personal portfolio webpage using HTML and CSS. The goal was to build a basic single-page website where a developer can showcase their projects and introduce themselves. The webpage includes sections like Home, About, Projects, Contact, and a footer. A sticky navigation bar at the top helps users jump to different sections easily. The "Home" section gives a short welcome message, while the "About" section explains who the developer is. The "Projects" section highlights sample work using neat cards with titles and short descriptions. The "Contact" section shares an email address, and the footer wraps up the page.

The entire design was styled using CSS to make it attractive and responsive. I used layout techniques like Flexbox and Grid to ensure the site works well on all screen sizes, including mobile. Colors, spacing, fonts, and hover effects were added for a modern and clean look. Though the project didnâ€™t require JavaScript, the structure allows for future improvements like animations or extra features. This task helped me practice frontend web development and complete a fully working, mobile-friendly portfolio using only HTML and CSS, just as required.
